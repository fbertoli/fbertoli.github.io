---

I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the Australian National University.
I am also a member of the Decision Sciences research group in Data61 (CSIRO), working on Logistics and Transportation. 

I was born and grew up in Milan (Italy) but I currently live in Sydney. 

Before moving to Australia for my PhD, I obtained a master degree in mathematics from the University of Milan.

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
