I am interested in transportation and logistic problems. In my PhD, I am focusing my research on tactical routing problems. Examples of such problems are: optimal fleet design or territory (district) design for routing applications. </br></br>
I previously worked on Monte Carlo methods and their applications to stochastic optimal control problems.
