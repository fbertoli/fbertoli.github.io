I am interested in transportation and logistic problems. In my PhD, I am focusing my research on tactical vehicle routing problems. Examples of such problems are: optimal fleet design or territory (district) design for vehicle routing applications. 

I previously worked on Monte Carlo methods and their applications to stochastic optimal control problems.
